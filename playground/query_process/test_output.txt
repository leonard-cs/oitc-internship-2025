🧪 Test 1/20

Reference: number of orders placed last month
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 2/20

🧪 Test 3/20
Query: While waiting for my coffee I realized — do we have any pending shipments in the orders table?
Generated: pending shipments in the orders table
Reference: pending shipments in orders table
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 4/20
Query: I was chatting with John and he said there were duplicate emails in the customer database — is that true?
Generated: duplicate emails in customer database
Reference: duplicate emails in customer table
❌ FAILED
Reason: The generated summary changes a specific field ('customer table') to a more general term ('database'), which could potentially alter the scope of data being queried. This might result in retrieving duplicate records across multiple tables rather than just within one customer-related table.

🧪 Test 5/20
Query: Just wondering if you can pull up the list of products that are out of stock. I need it for a report.
Generated: list of out-of-stock products
Reference: products that are out of stock
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 6/20

Reference: invoices issued in June 2023
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 7/20
Query: By the way, happy Monday! Can you find employees who joined after 2022?
Generated: employees who joined after 2022
Reference: employees who joined after 2022
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 8/20
Query: Oh shoot, I meant to ask yesterday — what’s the total revenue from orders this quarter?
Generated: total revenue from orders for this fiscal period
Reference: total revenue from orders this quarter
❌ FAILED
Reason: The generated summary changes 'this quarter' to 'this fiscal period'. While both terms refer to a similar timeframe within the company’s financial year, they are not always interchangeable. A fiscal period could be longer than one calendar quarter and may include multiple quarters or even an entire year if it aligns with specific reporting periods of the business.

🧪 Test 9/20
Query: My manager is on my case again 🙄 — can you pull customers with no purchases in the last year?
Generated: customers who haven't made a purchase in the past year
Reference: customers with no purchases in the last year
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 10/20
Query: Not sure if this makes sense, but can you show all product names and their stock count?
Generated: product list with stock information
Reference: product names and stock count
❌ FAILED
Reason: The generated summary does not explicitly mention product names and their corresponding stock count. While it suggests that a 'list' is being provided which could include such details, the omission of explicit reference to both elements introduces ambiguity about whether this list will contain only products or other types of data as well (e.g., suppliers). Therefore, without additional context confirming equivalence in scope and detail between the two summaries, we cannot assume they convey identical retrieval intent.


atus?
Generated: number of orders with processing status
Reference: orders with status processing
❌ FAILED
Reason: The generated summary changes the meaning by replacing a phrase that implies an ongoing process ('status processing') with one that suggests counting or quantifying something in progress. This could lead to confusion about whether it's asking for active orders still being processed.

🧪 Test 12/20
Query: Sorry if this is dumb, but what's the average delivery time for completed orders?
Generated: average delivery time for completed orders
Reference: average delivery time for completed orders
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 13/20
Query: I hope you can help — find top 5 customers by total order value. Thanks!
Generated: top 5 customers by total order value
Reference: top 5 customers by total order value
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 14/20
Query: I was cleaning up some data and got curious — which suppliers are from China?
Generated: suppliers from China
Reference: suppliers from China
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 15/20
Query: Random question during lunch — how many unique products have been sold?
Generated: number of distinctly sold items
Reference: number of unique products sold
❌ FAILED
Reason: The phrase 'distinctly sold items' is ambiguous and could imply that only one instance per unique item was counted. This differs from the standard interpretation of counting each sale as a separate event for different products.

🧪 Test 16/20
Query: I know this is last minute, but get all orders shipped via FedEx last month?
Generated: orders shipped via FedEx in the previous month.
Reference: orders shipped via FedEx last month
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 17/20
Query: Before I hop off this call — show me customers with more than 3 returns.
Generated: customers with more than 3 returns
Reference: customers with more than 3 returns
✅ PASSED

🧪 Test 18/20
Query: Can you check if any products have a negative stock quantity? Weird bug maybe?
Generated: products with negative stock
Reference: products with negative stock quantity
❌ FAILED
Reason: The generated summary omits a crucial quantifier ('quantity') which is essential for understanding that we are referring to products where the inventory level has fallen below zero. Without this specification, it's unclear whether all items with negative stock or just one item at any given time would be retrieved.

🧪 Test 19/20
Query: LOL I almost forgot — are there any employees without an assigned department?
Generated: employees without a department
Reference: employees without an assigned department
❌ FAILED
Reason: The generated summary omits the word 'assigned,' which is crucial in understanding that we are looking for employees who do not have any department at all. This could result in retrieving data about part-time or temporary workers without departments assigned to them, rather than full-time permanent staff with no current assignments.

🧪 Test 20/20
Query: During my walk I remembered this — which orders were cancelled in December?
Generated: cancelled orders in December
Reference: orders cancelled in December
❌ FAILED
Reason: The generated summary lacks specificity and clarity. The term 'orders' is too broad without specifying which type of order or the reason for cancellation within the context provided by the reference summary.
