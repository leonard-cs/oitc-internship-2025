- **System Prompt:** A hidden instruction provided by the system (OpenAI, developers, or applications) that defines the AI's role, behavior, and limitations.
- **User Prompt:** The message entered by the user during interaction.

**Note:** System prompts take precedence over user prompts. If there is a conflict between the two, the system prompt will override the user prompt.
